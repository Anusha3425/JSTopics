// Babel is javascript compiler.
// The technique called transpiling (transformation + compiling) is 
// based on the usage of special tools to transform ES6 code into equivalent or close matches that works in ES5 environments
// transpil code into older versions of code or compatible for developers

// ECMA Script is the JavaScript language specification
// ES6 is the stable version of Javascript which can run in all older and newer browsers

// Features: let and const, arrow functions, classes, closures, template strings, promises,
// default, rest and spread operators, object literals

// Babel transpiler converts newer version code into the one which is understood by older browsers.
